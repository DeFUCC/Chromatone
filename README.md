# Chromatone
Visual music language interactive education, research and practice tools

Chromatone is based on a scientific view on human perception of colors, notes and their relationships. 
A is first among those 12 notes that equally divide cyclical octaves. Red is first visible color in spectrum, that we can join into a cycle and equally divide into 12 steps. So we come up with a connection of two sense systems, that happens in our brain. And it appears to be a great tool for better understanding of the worlds of light, sounds and their perception.

We develop a toolset for anyone who wants to see music and hear colors by themselves. Yes, it's an artifical synesthesia development toolkit.
